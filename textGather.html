    <h2>The Fool - Those Who Didn't Vote</h2>
    <p>Meaning: Meaning: New Beginnings, Optimism, Trust</p>
    <p>The Fool is a journeyer of life, setting out on a grand adventure without a map, trusting that everything will turn out splendidly!</p>
    <p>Introduction: The Fool is always an indicator of newness; as well as the purity and open-hearted energy of a child. This is generally considered a positive card, with the caveat that it's important to take time to be sure that you are "looking where you're going."</p>
    <p>General: In general, this card would indicate new beginnings that have some deeper spiritual meaning - for example, starting a meditation practice or a relationship, as opposed to buying a new pair of shoes. The appearance of the fool can depict an important "fresh start."</p>

    <h2>The Magician — Bernie Sanders</h2>
    <p>Meaning: Manifestation, Personal Power, Creativity</p>
    <p>“You have the power to create and make things happen! Once you become aware of the full extent of your own power, nothing can stand in your way..”</p>
    <p>Introduction: The Magician is about making higher - and better - use of all of one's power. Spiritual, emotional, and otherwise. This is another card that often signifies new beginnings and great expectations. This is a very powerful, positive omen in a reading. This card reminds us that we have the power to make a difference, in our lives and in the greater world, if we simply make a point to try.</p>
    <p>General: You may notice many synchronicities, which point towards deep, spiritual events taking place regardless of the "importance" of their superficial appearances. You should be finding that you have the knowledge, strength, and inspiration needed to meet your challenges. In general this is a very positive time for you.</p>

    <h2>The High Priestess - Hillary Clinton</h2>
    <p>Meaning: Inaction, Going Within, The Subconscious</p>
    <p>Full of secrets and mysteries as she beckons you to explore the unknown depths of your soul</p>
    <p>Introduction: The High Priestess is a very spiritual card - often with sexual overtones. It can mean that the querent is in a phase where he or she is going to be much more physically attractive to others. She is tied to the moon, to femininity, and to inspiration.</p>
    <p>General: This is a time to rely on your intuition and your inner knowledge, rather than your conscious mind or intellect. Pay attention to your dreams. Synchronicities are likely now. When the High Priestess appears in a man's reading, she also often represents a woman that he will want badly; but whom he may not be able to get.</p>

    <h2>The Empress - Michelle Obama</h2>
    <p>Meaning: Creativity, nurturing and abundance!</p>
    <p>Positive self talk, affirmations, being kind to yourself, celebrating your talents and successes – all of this will create fertile soil for your dreams to take root and grow</p>
    <p>Introduction: The Empress is an archetype of feminine power; she is watery, hard to fathom, mysterious, fertile, and sexual. She augurs a need for us to be in touch with our feminine side, to listen to our intuition, and to give priority to our emotions an passions. She can signify coming abundance.</p>
    <p>General: People are going to be more attracted to you than usual (in every sense) and you are likely to find people on your doorstep, wanting your advice/your shoulder to cry on. This will be beneficial to you because you are now going to be able to see yourself more in the way that others see you - as someone with wisdom, and a lot to offer. So share your hard-won perspectives on life, know that your wisdom and caring is valuable.</p>

    <h2>The Emperor - Barack Obama</h2>
    <p>Meaning: Structure, Stability, Rules and Power</p>
    <p>Has strong boundaries and a clear, rational mind and knows what can be achieved with clear intention and determination</p>
    <p>Introduction: The Emperor shows us that domination of the mind over the heart is sometimes not wanted, but in some cases is it necessary and even welcomed, and that this is part of what we must think about when he appears. When hard choices must be made it's important to maintain your concentration and focus, and this is something this time period will make it easy for you to do. Enjoy the assertiveness and confidence it that this self-control and focus brings. Forge ahead and do what you know is best. If you can master yourself then you should have little problem mastering the world and all the things in it.</p>
    <p>General: It looks as though a kind, older man may be part of your scenario. This could be a work colleague, or your father or a father-type figure. Perhaps he will be interested in you romantically. If so, don't rule him out, just because of his age. You may feel that this man sort of "rules with an iron fist" and that can be frustrating at times, but he is trying to help you to see that rules have their place and their reasons - and you will come out all the better for it. Above all else, this man teaches - without even trying, perhaps - the benefits of structure and logic ruling over the emotions and lesser desires.</p>

    <h2>The Hierophant - The Democratic Ideal</h2>
    <p>Meaning: Institutions, tradition, society and its rules</p>
    <p>Represents the belief systems in our lives – school, church, corporate culture, patriarchy, consumerism, government – and the influence they have on us</p>
    <p>Introduction: The Hierophant is very much about "doing the right thing." You may be struggling with an issue and are unsure about what is "right" for you to do. Know that the answers are within you. Remember that the "right" thing is what is right for you also.</p>
    <p>General: This is also a card that is very much about spirituality - everything from traditional religion to earth-centered spirituality and any other spiritual notion that you can conceive of. There may be a tension between your idea of spirituality and the "right thing" and the ideas of others around you. Stand up for your own beliefs. The "rules" and the "system" of doing things are probably playing a major role now. Rituals of any sort will be helpful to you now, even if it's just "a movie with friends every third Saturday."</p>

    <h2>The Lovers - Bernie Supporters</h2>
    <p>Meaning: Being drawn to someone or something, balance, choice or dilemma</p>
    <p>Introduction: The Lovers is associated with the astrological sign of Gemini, "The Twins." It almost always points to partnerships with just one other person; generally, and not surprisingly, this indicates a romantic partnership, but of course this is not always the case. Less frequently, it points to the duality that all of us have inwardly - between male/female, yin/yang, approach/avoidance, and the like.</p>
    <p>General: It's possible when this card appears that you are feeling ambivalent about a relationship or situation in your life. It could be that your heart is telling you one thing, and your head, another. In general, the thing to do is (within the bounds of your morality) to follow your heart. Some people say there are only two modes that any of us are operating under at any time; and that's "fear" or "love." When you can: choose love.</p>

    <h2>The Chariot - Stephen Bannon</h2>
    <p> Meaning: forward movement, success, overcoming obstacles, travel</p>
    <p>The Chariot is a card of moving onward and upward as you conquer that which stands in your way on your journey to succeed. Ironically, the figure in this card doesn’t really look like he is going anywhere</p>
    <p>Introduction: The Chariot indicates a lot of energy but not free-for-all energy. It's directed, controlled, and has a goal in mind. When this card appears you are likely to be fairly clear on what your hopes and dreams involve and what you are willing to do to get there.</p>
    <p>General: In general this card points to determination and ambition, getting things done, and testing and proving what you've got. This is a sign that you should move forward with whatever you have in mind (and in your heart) and give it your best shot. Remember, though, that you'll need to use both your intellect and your heart, in order to be truly successful.</p>

    <h2>Strength - Black Lives Matter</h2>
    <p>Meaning: patience, right use of power, conquering fear</p>
    <p>Indicates a wise kind of power – one that does not seek power over others, but the power to explore and unconditionally love one’s whole self</p>
    <p>Introduction: Strength indicates the importance of mind over matter, and reminds you to focus on what you do want rather than what you don't want in your life. Its main point is that you have the ability to harness your thoughts and to use them for your - and everyone else's - highest good. Not only do you have the ability; you have the responsibility. So conquer your fears, control your impulses, and never lose patience with yourself or what you are doing.</p>
    <p>General: It's important now for you to make time to meditate and contemplate and spend some time alone even if you are in a committed relationship and have nineteen children! Do not allow yourself to spend time in preoccupation and fear. Outward things will be going all right but what is of the most paramount importance is keeping your head on straight.</p>

    <h2>The Hermit - The Voter</h2>
    <p>Meaning: Meditation, Consciousness and Solitude.</p>
    <p>In many ways, The Hermit is like the more mature, wiser version of The Fool.</p>
    <p>ntroduction: The Hermit is an extremely spiritual card, and often has to do with institutions and large organizations - everything from a bank to the entire Christian Church. This card indicates spirituality even if you are an atheist. It's in whatever sense the word "spirit" makes sense to you, even if for you "spirit" equates to "emotion." You may be trying hard to figure out what the "truth" is about someone (or some matter), don't feel that you have to do it all on your own, ask for help if you need it to gain different perspectives, more information, etc.</p>
    <p>General: Just like with the Strength card, you may even more so be in the frame of mind that you need some time alone - don't be afraid to take it. Even if it's just a five minute walk around the house so that you can clear your head. This is also very much a card about "trying very hard to do the right thing." Just make sure that "doing the right thing" includes doing what is right for you personally, and not just worrying about the wants and needs of others.</p>

    <h2>Wheel of Fortune - Four More Years</h2>
    <p>meaning: Cycles, change, ups and downs of life, good luck</p>
    <p>get centered within yourself and detach from the worldly drama and desire for material objects and social status, so that you do not feel pulled in all directions as you move through life</p>
    <p>Introduction: The Wheel of Fortune tells you that in general, it looks as though things are changing. In most cases, this indicates positive, needed changes but for some people, change itself is very difficult and can almost be traumatic. This is a very spiritual and "Karmically" oriented time. Change is part of the cyclical nature of life.</p>
    <p>General: This card always reminds us that "this too shall pass." Whether that's good times or bad times, it passes. If suddenly you find yourself "sitting on top of the world," keep your perspective, as that too, like everything else, changes. Live in the now, count your blessings, and just realize that much of life is outside of your control, but that even that is okay. Roll with any changes, and think positively.</p>

    <h2>Justice - Elizabeth Warren</h2>
    <p>Meaning: Fairness, equality and balance.</p>
    <p>She encourages us to think carefully about what we project out into our world as the law of cause and effect will always prevail</p>
    <p>ntroduction: Justice deals with the idea of karma and the law of cause and effect, stating that all events, and all people, are connected. It's important to remember that not everything you are dealing with, however, is a direct result of your own actions or karma. Sometimes you will be called upon to deal with the results of the actions of someone you care about, and this can sometimes be as difficult and demanding as it is when you're up against something that is completely of your own making. Don't blame yourself unnecessarily</p>
    <p>General: This card evokes the need for fairness, balance, and harmony. Operate in as balanced and reasonable a fashion as you can. This includes in how you think about and treat yourself. If you are directly involved with a court case, it is likely to be resolved, at least in large degree, in your favor.</p>

    <h2>The Hanged Man - Weiner and Wife</h2>
    <p>Meaning: a shameful image of a traitor being punished</p>
    <p>Ambiguity results from the fact that the card itself may be viewed inverted</p>
    <p>Introduction: The Hanged Man generally shows that you are at a crossroads - one with only two options i.e. in or out, up or down, yes or no. You may find yourself very much wanting to do "something" but having no idea what it is or how to do it. If that happens, that's a clear sign that you should stop, relax, and look at ways that you might need to let go of attempts to control life/situations/people/things</p>
    <p>General: It's possible that there is an outdated attitude or wish that you need to let go of. Any sacrifice that you make will open up your life to something even more positive than what you "let go of." All in all this should be a thoughtful, reflective time, particularly if you are willing to look at if or how you might best serve your own interests by being willing to change.</p>

    <h2>Death - Political Activism</h2>
    <p>Meaning: Many decks call this The Card With No Name: a less frightening meaning.</p>
    <p>The Death card usually depicts a skeleton, sometimes riding a horse but more often wielding a sickle. Surrounding it are dead and dying people from all classes, including kings, bishops and commoners.</p>
    <p>Introduction: Death does not necessarily, or even usually, indicate physical death. In fact, in general, it is considered irresponsible for readers to predict physical death, as we are creatures with free will, and such things are not written in stone. This card simply indicates transformation and change. This is definitely a time of deep transformation, likely to be both inner and outwardly in your life. Situations, things, and people that you have counted on or gotten used to may no longer be available to you in quite the same way as they once were, and this transition can be difficult for some people.</p>
    <p>General: The more accepting you can be of change of all sorts during this time, and the less you try to "control" the better and the more comfortable this time will be for you. Often what you need to "let go of" is some sort of self-limiting belief or attitude. Sometimes we just can't see how our attitudes are hurting us, and when that is true, this time period can be a wake-up call. The energy of this time is not just change or destruction; it is change or destruction followed by renewal. Even though one door may have closed, another is opening. Will you have the courage to step through?</p>

    <h2>Temperance - The Electoral College</h2>
    <p>This card was a standard symbol of the virtue temperance</p>
    <p>Introduction: Temperance is a card about balance, in many ways, and relationships of all kinds. Friendships, family, romantic partnerships, and work partnerships all need your attention. This is also a card about alchemy or mixing and matching. You may have to try several approaches to things before you find what is truly right for you.</p>
    <p>General: Although in general all your relationships are likely to be going quite well, you may need to look at your deeper personal issues and see if or how these are standing in your way. And if they are, how to work through them and integrate them. The idea now is to do what it takes to find balance, in yourself, in your relationships, and with your goals and aspirations.</p>
    <p>General: Although in general all your relationships are likely to be going quite well, you may need to look at your deeper personal issues and see if or how these are standing in your way. And if they are, how to work through them and integrate them. The idea now is to do what it takes to find balance, in yourself, in your relationships, and with your goals and aspirations.</p>

    <h2>The Devil - He Who Will Not Be Named</h2>
    <p>A raised right hand and lowered left hand with a torch. He squats on a square gold pedestal</p>
    <p>Being seduced by the material world and physical pleasures; lust for and an obsession with money and power. Also: Living in fear, domination and bondage; being caged by an overabundance of luxury; discretion should be used in personal and business matters.</p>
    <p>Introduction: The Devil is not as frightening a card to interpret as the depiction on most cards indicates. It is a card about bondage but often this bondage is metaphoric and internal. With this card  you are called to look beyond superficial appearances and to go deeper into the truth and meaning of a situation. You also are asked to remember that  when you're feeling restrained you nearly always hold the keys to your own freedom. Don't give up hope!</p>
    <p>General: It's important for you to remember that no matter what your situation, that you always have options to choose from. First things first, don't let other people tell you that your options are limited. If you come to that conclusion, be sure that you are coming to it on your own. Regardless, it will be crucial to remember that you can free yourself from whatever restrictions are holding you back, at any time you choose to do so. You may have the feeling now that you are not in control of your life; sometimes this happens as a result of your own actions, but more often as a byproduct of inaction.  So, take action, take whatever steps you can to give yourself the feeling, however slight, of being in control. Even if that is merely making a choice on what you are going to have for dinner. Small steps are important, too.</p>

    <h2>The Tower - Houses the Devil</h2>
    <p>Our expulsion from the garden of democracy</p>
    <p>Introduction: The Tower is a card about change. Just as with the Devil and Death, the Tower is not as frightening or as ominous as the pictorial representation in most decks. Trying to hold too tightly to the status quo can be disastrous now.  Roll with the changes.</p>
    <p>General: It is likely that some people/situations that you have counted on as being there for you may no longer be there in quite the same way. This doesn't have to be dire; change is the nature of life, and trying to prevent it is like trying to row upstream without a paddle. If  you have been building castles in the air this may be the time that some of them come crashing down to earth. That's only a problem if you let it be. You will be able to replace them with some more realistic and reachable dreams and goals if some fantasies fall apart this month. Dreaming is important, but it's also important to be living in reality too. You will get through this time just fine; particularly if you remember that you have all the resources you need, already inside you, to deal with life and to do what you need to do.</p>

    <h2>The Star - Rightside Up Femininism Upside Down The Trump Women</h2>
    <p>A naked woman kneels by the water; one foot is in the water, one foot is on the land. Above her head a star shines out. In each hand she holds a jug. From one jug she pours a liquid into the water. From the other jug she pours a liquid onto the land. In other, older decks, a woman (or sometimes even a man) is simply looking and sometimes gesturing at a large star in the sky.</p>
    <p>Introduction:  When the Star appears, you are likely to find yourself feeling rather inspired. You will be feeling more hopeful about the future, and more confident that your needs - whether these are emotional or financial needs or both - will be met. This is also a very spiritual card. You may find yourself for a time feeling at one with all of creation. Savor it.</p>
    <p>General: This card is a definite good omen. You are probably already inclined to be thinking positively; this is a time to do so specifically. What are the changes that you would like to make or see in your life? Make a list. You can accomplish nearly anything that you set out to do now. Think big.</p>

    <h2>The Moon - Our Future</h2>
    <p>Two large, foreboding pillars are shown. A wolf and a domesticated dog howl at the moon. A crayfish appears in the water. The Moon is "shedding the moisture of fertilizing dew in great drops</p>
    <p>Introduction: The Moon indicates that things may seem somewhat confusing to you now. You may find it hard to understand where you are coming from, much less what others are thinking and feeling! You need to try to sit with the uncertainty, don't try to force things or people to do things before they are ready. This card is the "Pisces" of the tarot deck.</p>
    <p>General: You are definitely in a more psychic and intuitive phase than usual, so it will be important for you to trust your instincts and your impressions, even if you don't know where they are coming from. Also, not that you need to be mistrusting, but it will be helpful for you to realize that when this card appears, it's possible that all is not what it seems. If you feel you can't trust someone, then you probably can't. Go with your gut. If you are waiting on an answer from someone, it may, unfortunately, take longer than you would like for it to. Try to stay patient.</p>

    <h2>The Sun - Hope for Our Future</h2>
    <p>attained knowledge. An infant rides a white horse under the anthropomorphized sun, with sunflowers in the background. The child of life holds a red flag, representing the blood of renewal while a smiling sun shines down on him, representing accomplishment. The conscious mind prevails over the fears and illusions of the unconscious</p>
    <p>Introduction: When the Sun card shows for you, it's a sign that soon you are likely to find yourself feeling more free than you have in a while - maybe years. This is a great time to take a vacation and to experience different things. The Sun is about vitality, freedom, joy, and self-expression.</p>
    <p>General: Things in general are very likely to be going very well for you. However, even though finances are likely to be in good shape when this card appears, that does not mean that you should lose focus on what is truly important in life, and money is not very high on that list. This is a good time to socialize, to meet new people, and to get out and about.</p>

    <h2>Judgement - Political Awareness</h2>
    <p>An angel, possibly Gabriel, is depicted blowing a great trumpet, from which hangs a white flag bearing a red cross. A group of humans (man, woman, and child) of grayish complexion stand, arms spread, looking up at the angel in awe. The people are apparently emerging from crypts or graves. There are huge mountains or tidal waves in the background. These may be a reference to the sea giving up its dead on the day of judgment, as described in the Book of Revelation.</p>
    <p>Introduction: Judgment can be a card about jumping to conclusions, decisions and judgments. which are too hastily made. If you are prone to such things, this is a clear signal to slow down and give things more thought and to give people "more chances." This can be a real time of spiritual awakening.</p>
    <p>General: In general, if you are the one tending to jump to conclusions, you can put a stop to it. If others are making these kinds of decisions about you or about someone you care for, there is really very little you can do, apart from realizing that it's their problem, not yours.</p>

    <h2>The World</h2>
    <p>The World represents an ending to a cycle of life, a pause in life before the next big cycle beginning with the fool.[2] The figure is at once male and female, above and below, suspended between the heavens and the earth. It is completeness. It is also said to represent cosmic consciousness; the potential of perfect union with the One Power of the universe.[3] It tells us full happiness is also to give back to the world, sharing what we have learned or gained.</p>
    <p>Introduction: The World can signify that you are figuratively feeling the weight of the world on your shoulders, which is not an easy place to be. It's an excellent time to review how well you do at "asking for help" when you need it. Remember you don't have to do everything on your own.</p>
    <p>General: This can often be a card of completion. You've worked hard, and you are almost to the "finish line" in some way. Don't quit now that you're almost finished! You're almost definitely in need of some well deserved rest and relaxation; don't be afraid to take it. You are getting closer to "who you really are," at your deepest levels.</p>
